         Actually, make lemon ice for infused water. At first, I just wanted to
         make milk tea, but how come I was tempted to add lemon, which was
         already made into ice cubes? Sooo, be iced lemon milk tea. It tastes
         fresh, sweet, exciting because of the cold lemon and sweet milk tea.

      <h3>Ingredient :</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>2 lemon-flavored tea bags</li>
         <li>236 ml of boiling water</li>
         <li>5 pieces of ice cubes</li>
         <li>4 teaspoons of sweetened condensed milk</li>
         <li>3 teaspoons of honey</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps :</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Dip the tea bag in hot water until the water changes color, about 3
            to 5 minutes.
         </li>
         <li>Discard the tea bag and let the tea cool.</li>
         <li>
            Put ice cubes, sweetened condensed milk and honey into a glass. Stir
            well.
         </li>
         <li>
            Pour the tea into the glass and stir again. (If the tea is still
            warm, the ice may melt, add more ice if it's not cold enough.)
         </li>
         <li>Lemon-flavored milk tea is ready to be enjoyed.</li>
      </ol>
