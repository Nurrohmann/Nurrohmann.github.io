         Sweet iced tea is almost on every restaurant drink menu in Indonesia.
         However, restaurant-style sweet iced tea is usually different from what
         you make at home.

         In addition, the sugar is also boiled beforehand so it dissolves easily
         in the iced tea and the sweetness feels just right. Check out the
         restaurant-style sweet iced tea recipe from Sajian Sedap below.

            Bring 400 milliliters of water to a boil, then pour in the tea. Cook
            five minutes over low heat, turn off the stove. Set aside and do not
            strain the tea, let it further dissolve.
         </li>
         <li>
            Continue to make the syrup ingredients, bring to a boil 300
            milliliters of water. Add sugar and pandan leaves. Cook until the
            sugar dissolves, help by stirring.

            Prepare a glass, fill ice cubes in a ratio of one to one with tea
            water, for example 100 grams of ice cubes to one hundred milliliters
            of tea water. Strain the tea, pour it into a glass and add sugar
            syrup to taste.
